TI Determination of the composition, encapsulation efficiency and loading
   capacity in protein drug delivery systems using circular dichroism
   spectroscopy
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Peptides and proteins have become very promising drug candidates in recent decades due to their unique properties. However, the application of these drugs has been limited by their high enzymatic susceptibility, low membrane permeability and poor bioavailability when administered orally. Considerable efforts have been made to design and develop drug delivery systems that could transport peptides and proteins to targeted area. Although it is of great importance to determine the composition after loading a drug to the carrier, the ability to do so is significantly limited by current analytical methods. In this letter, five important proteins, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, hemoglobin human, human serum albumin, human transferrin and r-globulin were chemically conjugated to two model drug carriers, namely carbon dots and polymer O-(2-carboxyethyl)polyethylene glycol. A simple yet convenient method based on circular dichroism spectroscopy was developed to determine the compositions of the various protein-carrier conjugates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The modulation of collagen turnover can be a relevant pharmacological target in the context of treating either pathological or pathophysiological conditions, such as collagen-related diseases and skin aging. Our recent work has focused on the search for short-chain peptides as lead compounds for further development of compounds that enhance the production of typeI collagen. In this study we selected and synthesized overlapping peptides of the C-terminal portion of serpinA1 (residues 393-418), the impact of which on collagen production has been reported previously, in order to identify shorter and still active fragments and to provide insight on the mechanisms involved. The biological activity of each fragment was evaluated with cultured normal human dermal fibroblasts, and changes in the amounts of collagen were monitored in collected culture media by a sandwich ELISA technique developed in house. Interestingly, we identified a decapeptide, termed SA1-III (Ac-MGKVVNPTQK-NH2), as a promising candidate for our purposes; it is able to induce a significant increase in typeI collagen levels in the culture medium of treated cells at micromolar concentrations.

TI Hen egg white ovomacroglobulin promotes fibroblast migration via
   mediating cell adhesion and cytoskeleton
SO JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Hen egg white ovomacroglobulin (OVM) possesses a variety of bioactivities and could potentially be used as a pharmaceutical agent. It has been reported that OVM is involved in wound healing and cancer pathological processes, and previous results suggest that OVM plays a potential role in cell proliferation and migration; however, this has not yet been proven. In the present study, the effects of OVMon fibroblast proliferation and migration were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Results of cell counting, cell viability, and cell cycle indicated that proliferation of fibroblasts was not altered by OVM treatment. However, scratch assays showed that OVM could promote the migration of 3 T6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human skin fibroblasts (HSF). Also, the adhesion of HSF to the collagen matrix was also enhanced by OVM treatment. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis showed that.. 1-integrin,.. -tubulin, and.. -actin were up-regulated while E-cadherin was down-regulated in OVM-treated HSF cells. The effect of OVM was silenced after forming a complex with trypsin, suggesting that the protease inhibitory ability of OVM is important for its effect on cell migration.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggested that promotion of OVM on cell migration was achieved by enhancing cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, reducing intercellular aggregation, and strengthening cytoskeleton. The finding of the promotion effect of OVMon cell migration is important for understanding its role in wound healing and cancer pathological processes. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

TI The Antifibrotic Effect of alpha 2AP Neutralization in Systemic
   Sclerosis Dermal Fibroblasts and Mouse Models of Systemic Sclerosis
SO JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY
AB Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease of autoimmune origin characterized by the fibrosis of skin and visceral organs, and peripheral circulatory disturbance. We recently demonstrated that alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2AP), which is the physiological inhibitor of plasmin, is associated with the development of fibrosis. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of alpha 2AP in the pathogenesis of SSc. The administration of alpha 2AP in mice induced profibrotic changes, such as increased dermal thickness, collagen production, and myofibroblast differentiation. Conversely, the alpha 2AP neutralization prevented not only profibrotic changes, but also the production of autoantibodies in bleomycin-induced mouse models of SSc. The expression of alpha 2AP was elevated in dermal fibroblasts obtained from patients with SSc. Furthermore, alpha 2AP treatment promoted profibrotic changes in human normal dermal fibroblasts, and alpha 2AP neutralization reversed a profibrotic phenotype of SSc dermal fibroblasts, in the absence of plasmin. Our findings demonstrated that alpha 2AP has a profibrotic effect probably not by the action as a plasmin inhibitor, and that the blocking of alpha 2AP exerts an antifibrotic effect in humans and mice with SSc.

TI Comparative Leaves Transcriptome Analysis Emphasizing on Accumulation of
   Anthocyanins in Brassica: Molecular Regulation and Potential Interaction
   with Photosynthesis
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The purple leaf pigmentation mainly associated with anthocyanins accumulation is common in Brassica but the mechanisms of its production and its potential physiological functions are poorly understood. Here, we performed the phenotypic, cytological, physiological, and comparative leaves transcriptome analyses of 11 different varieties belonging to five Brassica species with purple or green leaves. We observed that the anthocyanin was accumulated in most of vegetative tissues in all species and also in reproduction organs of B. carinata. Anthocyanin accumulated in different part of purple leaves including adaxial and abaxial epidermal cells as well as palisade and spongy mesophyll cells. Leave transcriptome analysis showed that almost all late biosynthetic genes (LBGs) of anthocyanin, especially Dihydroflayonol 4-Reductase (DFR), Anthocyanidin Synthase (ANS) and Transparent Testa 19 (TT19), were highly up regulated in all purple leaves. However, only one of transcript factors in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, Transparent Testa 8 (TT8), was up regulated along with those genes in all purple leaves, indicating its pivotal role for anthocyanin production in Brassica. Interestingly, with the up-regulation of genes for anthocyanin synthesis, Cytosolic 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PLG5) which involved in the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway was up-regulated in all purple leaves and three genes FISH PROTEASE 8 (FTS8), GLYCOLATE OXIDASE 1 (GOX1), and GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE 1;4 (GLN1;4) related to degradation of photo-damaged proteins in photosystem II and light respiration were down-regulated. These results highlighted the potential physiological functions of anthocyanin accumulation related to photosynthesis which might be of great worth in future.

TI Neutrophil-Derived Proteases Escalate Inflammation through Activation of
   IL-36 Family Cytokines
SO CELL REPORTS
AB Recent evidence has strongly implicated the IL-1 family cytokines IL-36 alpha, IL-36 beta, and IL-36 gamma as key initiators of skin inflammation. Similar to the other members of the IL-1 family, IL-36 cytokines are expressed as inactive precursors and require proteolytic processing for activation; however, the responsible proteases are unknown. Here, we show that IL-36 alpha, IL-36 beta, and IL-36 gamma are activated differentially by the neutrophil granule-derived proteases cathepsin G, elastase, and proteinase-3, increasing their biological activity similar to 500-fold. Active IL-36 promoted a strong pro-inflammatory signature in primary keratinocytes and was sufficient to perturb skin differentiation in a reconstituted 3D human skin model, producing features resembling psoriasis. Furthermore, skin eluates from psoriasis patients displayed significantly elevated cathepsin G-like activity that was sufficient to activate IL-36 beta. These data identify neutrophil granule proteases as potent IL-36-activating enzymes, adding to our understanding of how neutrophils escalate inflammatory reactions. Inhibition of neutrophil-derived proteases may therefore have therapeutic benefits in psoriasis.

TI Guggulsterone for Chemoprevention of Cancer
SO CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB Guggulsterone [4, 17(20)-pregnadiene-3, 16-dione] is a plant sterol derived from the gum resin of the tree Commiphora wightii. The gum resin of the guggul tree has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat obesity, liver disorders, internal tumors, malignant sores, ulcers, urinary complaints, intestinal worms, leucoderma, sinus, edema and sudden paralytic seizures. Guggulsterone has been shown to modulate the nuclear receptors, farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, CYP 2b10 gene expression, and the bile salt export pump for cholesterol elimination. Recent research indicates that the active components of gum guggul, E-and Z-guggulsterone have the potential to both prevent and treat cancers. Guggulsterone inhibits the growth of a wide variety of tumor cells and induces apoptosis through down regulation of antiapoptotic gene products (IAP1, xIAP, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-2, cFLIP, and survivin), modulation of cell cycle proteins (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), activation of caspases, inhibition of Akt, and activation of JNK. Guggulsterone modulates the expression of gene products involved in metastasis (MMP-9, COX-2, and VEGF) of tumor cells. Guggulsterone mediates gene expression through the modulation of several transcription factors, including NF-kappa B, STAT3, C/EBP alpha, androgen receptor, and glucocorticoid receptors. This review describes the anti-cancer properties, molecular targets, and the apoptotic effects of guggulsterone.

TI Donor platelet plasma components inactivate sensitive and multidrug
   resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates
SO PATHOGENS AND DISEASE
AB Acinetobacter baumannii is an environmentally resilient healthcare-associated opportunistic pathogen responsible for infections at many body sites. In the last 10 years, clinical strains resistant to many or all commonly used antibiotics have emerged globally. With few antimicrobial agents in the pharmaceutical pipeline, new and alternative agents are essential. Platelets secrete a large number of proteins, including proteins with antimicrobial activity. In a previous study, we demonstrated that donor platelet supernatants and plasma significantly inhibited the growth of a reference strain of A. baumannii in broth and on skin. This inhibition appeared to be unrelated to the platelet activation state. In this study, we demonstrate that this growth inhibition extends to clinical multidrug resistant isolates. We also demonstrate that there is no relationship between this activity and selected platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins. Instead, the donor plasma components complement and alpha-2 macroglobulin are implicated.

TI Development of autoantibodies against muscle-specific FHL1 in severe
   inflammatory myopathies
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Mutations of the gene encoding four-and-a-half LIM domain 1 (FHL1) are the causative factor of several X-linked hereditary myopathies that are collectively termed FHL1-related myopathies. These disorders are characterized by severe muscle dysfunction and damage. Here, we have shown that patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) develop autoimmunity to FHL1, which is a muscle-specific protein. Anti-FHL1 autoantibodies were detected in 25% of IIM patients, while patients with other autoimmune diseases or muscular dystrophies were largely anti-FHL1 negative. Anti-FHL1 reactivity was predictive for muscle atrophy, dysphagia, pronounced muscle fiber damage, and vasculitis. FHL1 showed an altered expression pattern, with focal accumulation in the muscle fibers of autoantibody-positive patients compared with a homogeneous expression in anti-FHL1-negative patients and healthy controls. We determined that FHL1 is a target of the cytotoxic protease granzyme B, indicating that the generation of FHL1 fragments may initiate FHL1 autoimmunity. Moreover, immunization of myositis-prone mice with FHL1 aggravated muscle weakness and increased mortality, suggesting a direct link between anti-FHL1 responses and muscle damage. Together, our findings provide evidence that FHL1 may be involved in the pathogenesis not only of genetic FHL1-related myopathies but also of autoimmune IIM. Importantly, these results indicate that anti-FHL1 autoantibodies in peripheral blood have promising potential as a biomarker to identify a subset of severe IIM.

TI Mast cell tryptase and chymase in the progress of cutaneous vasculitis
SO ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB In animal models of vasculitis, mast cells are essential in the pathogenesis, but their involvement in human skin vasculitis is obscure. Because tryptase and chymase are potent serine proteinases in the secretory granules of mast cells, the purpose was to examine the number of mast cells expressing tryptase and chymase during the progress of cutaneous vasculitis. These numbers were correlated with the appearance of immunoreactants (C3c, fibrin, IgM, IgA and IgG) in vessel walls. For this, skin biopsies were taken from the healthy-looking skin, initial petechial lesion (IP), and palpable purpura (PP) of the leg of patients with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n = 10). The frozen biopsies were analysed using enzyme- and immunohistochemistry and direct immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The results show that there are no marked changes in the numbers of mast cells expressing chymase or tryptase proteins. Instead, chymase enzyme activity decreased, but the score of alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin staining increased, during the progress of vasculitis. The IF positivity of fibrin correlated positively with chymase activity (p = 0.01) and the ratio of chymase activity to tryptase protein in IP (p = 0.03), as well as with mast cells showing tryptase (p = 0.03) and chymase (p = 0.01) proteins in PP. The IF positivity of C3c correlated with the ratio of chymase activity to tryptase protein in IP (p = 0.01). In conclusion, chymase is partially inactivated in vasculitis possibly due to alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin. Several positive correlations between chymase and fibrin and/or C3c in IP or PP suggest that this enzyme is involved in the deposition of immunoreactants in the vessel wall.

TI Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia with generalized warts
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is a rare protein-losing enteropathy with lymphatic leakage into the small intestine. Dilated lymphatics in the small intestinal wall and mesentery are observed in this disease. Laboratory tests of PIL patients revealed hypoalbuminemia, lymphocytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia and increased stool alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance. Cell-mediated immunodeficiency is also present in PIL patients because of loss of lymphocytes. As a result, the patients are vulnerable to chronic viral infection and lymphoma. However, cases of PIL with chronic viral infection, such as human papilloma virus-induced warts, are rarely reported. We report a rare case of PIL with generalized warts in a 36-year-old male patient. PIL was diagnosed by capsule endoscopy and colonoscopic biopsy with histological tissue confirmation. Generalized warts were observed on the head, chest, abdomen, back, anus, and upper and lower extremities, including the hands and feet of the patient.

TI Heterozygous germline mutations in A2ML1 are associated with a disorder
   clinically related to Noonan syndrome
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
AB Noonan syndrome (NS) is a developmental disorder characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphisms and congenital heart defects. To date, all mutations known to cause NS are dominant, activating mutations in signal transducers of the RAS/ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In 25% of cases, however, the genetic cause of NS remains elusive, suggesting that factors other than those involved in the canonical RAS/MAPK pathway may also have a role. Here, we used family-based whole exome sequencing of a case-parent trio and identified a de novo mutation, p.(Arg802His), in A2ML1, which encodes the secreted protease inhibitor alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M)-like-1. Subsequent resequencing of A2ML1 in 155 cases with a clinical diagnosis of NS led to the identification of additional mutations in two families, p.(Arg802Leu) and p.(Arg592Leu). Functional characterization of these human A2ML1 mutations in zebrafish showed NS-like developmental defects, including a broad head, blunted face and cardiac malformations. Using the crystal structure of A2M, which is highly homologous to A2ML1, we identified the intramolecular interaction partner of p.Arg802. Mutation of this residue, p.Glu906, induced similar developmental defects in zebrafish, strengthening our conclusion that mutations in A2ML1 cause a disorder clinically related to NS. This is the first report of the involvement of an extracellular factor in a disorder clinically related to RASopathies, providing potential new leads for better understanding of the molecular basis of this family of developmental diseases.

TI Ni(II) ions cleave and inactivate human alpha-1 antitrypsin
   hydrolytically, implicating nickel exposure as a contributing factor in
   pathologies related to antitrypsin deficiency
SO METALLOMICS
AB Human alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an abundant serum protein present at a concentration of 1.0-1.5 g L-1. AAT deficiency is a genetic disease that manifests with emphysema and liver cirrhosis due to the accumulation of a misfolded AAT mutant in hepatocytes. Lung AAT amount is inversely correlated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a serious and often deadly condition, with increasing frequency in the aging population. Exposure to cigarette smoke and products of fossil fuel combustion aggravates AAT deficiency and COPD according to mechanisms that are not fully understood. Taking into account that these fumes contain particles that can release nickel to human airways and skin, we decided to investigate interactions of AAT with Ni(II) ions within the paradigm of Ni(II)-dependent peptide bond hydrolysis. We studied AAT protein derived from human blood using HPLC, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry. These studies were aided by spectroscopic experiments on model peptides. As a result, we identified three hydrolysis sites in AAT. Two of them are present in the N-terminal part of the molecule next to each other (before Thr-13 and Ser-14 residues) and effectively form one N-terminal cleavage site. The single C-terminal cleavage site is located before Ser-285. The N-terminal hydrolysis was more efficient than the C-terminal one, but both abolished the ability of AAT to inhibit trypsin in an additive manner. Nickel ions bound to hydrolysis products demonstrated an ability to generate ROS. These results implicate Ni(II) exposure as a contributing factor in AAT-related pathologies.

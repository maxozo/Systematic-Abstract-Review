TI Prognostic significance of beta 2-adrenergic receptor expression in
   malignant melanoma
SO TUMOR BIOLOGY
AB Recent studies cite beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) antagonists as novel therapeutic agents for melanoma, as they may reduce the disease progression. The beta 2AR has shown to be expressed in malignant melanoma. However, it remains unclear whether the beta 2AR expression has a clinical and pathological significance in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma. We herein conducted a clinicopathological study to investigate the protein expression of beta 2AR in malignant melanoma of the skin and its prognostic significance. One hundred thirty-three patients with surgically resected cutaneous malignant melanoma were evaluated. Tumor sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for beta 2AR, Ki-67, the microvessel density (MVD) determined by CD34, and p53. beta 2AR was highly expressed in 44.4 % (59 out of 133) of the patients. The expression of beta 2AR was significantly associated with the tumor thickness, ulceration, T factor, N factor, disease stage, tumor size, cell proliferation (Ki-67), and MVD (CD34). Using Spearman's rank test, the beta 2AR expression was correlated with Ki-67 (r=0.278; 95 % CI, 0.108 to 0.432; P=0.001), CD34 (r=0.445; 95 % CI, 0.293 to 0.575; P< 0.001), and the tumor size (r=0.226; 95 % CI, 0.053 to 0.386; P=0.008). Using a univariate analysis, the tumor thickness, ulceration, disease stage, beta 2AR, Ki-67, and CD34 had a significant relationship with the overall and progression-free survivals. A multivariable analysis confirmed that beta 2AR was an independent prognostic factor for predicting a poor overall survival (HR 1.730; 95 % CI 1.221-2.515) and progression-free survival (HR 1.576; 95 % CI 1.176-2.143) of malignant melanoma of the skin. beta 2AR can serve as a promising prognostic factor for predicting a worse outcome after surgical treatment and may play an important role in the development and aggressiveness of malignant melanoma.

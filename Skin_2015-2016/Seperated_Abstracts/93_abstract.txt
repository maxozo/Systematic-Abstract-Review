TI Molecular Determinants of the Human alpha(2C)-Adrenergic Receptor
   Temperature-Sensitive Intracellular Traffic
SO MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY
AB The human alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2C)-AR) is localized intracellularly at physiologic temperature. Decreasing the environmental temperature strongly stimulates the receptor transport to the cell surface. In contrast, rat and mouse alpha(2C)-AR plasma membrane levels are less sensitive to decrease in temperature, whereas the opossum alpha(2C)-AR cell surface levels are not changed in these conditions. Structural analysis demonstrated that human alpha(2C)-AR has a high number of arginine residues in the third intracellular loop and in the C-terminus, organized as putative RXR motifs. Although these motifs do not affect the receptor subcellular localization at 37 degrees C, deletion of the arginine clusters significantly enhanced receptor plasma membrane levels at reduced temperature. We found that this exaggerated transport of the human receptor is mediated by two functional arginine clusters, one in the third intracellular loop and one in the C-terminus. This effect is mediated by interactions with COPI vesicles, but not by 14-3-3 proteins. In rat alpha(2C)-AR, the arginine cluster from the third intracellular loop is shifted to the left due to three missing residues. Reinsertion of these residues in the rat alpha(2C)-AR restored the same temperature sensitivity as in the human receptor. Proteomic and coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified pontin as a molecule having stronger interactions with human alpha(2C)-AR compared with rat alpha(2C)-AR. Inhibition of pontin activity enhanced human receptor plasma membrane levels and signaling at 37 degrees C. Our results demonstrate that human alpha(2C)-AR has a unique temperature-sensitive traffic pattern within the G protein-coupled receptor class due to interactions with different molecular chaperones, mediated in part by strict spatial localization of specific arginine residues.

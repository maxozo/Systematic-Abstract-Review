TI Internalization of Near-Infrared Fluorescently Labeled Activatable
   Cell-Penetrating Peptide and of Proteins into Human Fibrosarcoma Cell
   Line HT-1080
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The internalization of near-infrared fluorescently labeled cargos into living cells and tissues allows a highly sensitive detection without interference from skin, porphins or other fluorescent cell and tissue compounds. In this study, the uptake of labeled bovine serum albumin and an antibody, into fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) cells was triggered by the formation of non-covalent complexes with different cell-penetrating peptides; uptake efficiency and intracellular localization were determined. To improve selectivity of internalization into tumor cells, a fluorescent activatable cell-penetrating peptide (ACPP) was synthesized and functionally characterized. This 25-mer peptide was designed to be activatable by Matrix-Metallo-Proteases (MMPs). Its uptake selectivity was estimated using cells with different MMP activities. J. Cell.

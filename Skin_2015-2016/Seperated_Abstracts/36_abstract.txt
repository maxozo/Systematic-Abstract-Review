TI Self-maintenance of neurogenic inflammation contributes to a vicious
   cycle in skin
SO EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
AB Cutaneous neurogenic inflammation (CNI) is frequently associated with skin disorders. CNI is not limited to the retrograde signalling of nociceptive sensory nerve endings but can instead be regarded as a multicellular phenomenon. Thus, soluble mediators participating in communication among sensory nerves, skin and immune cells are key components of CNI. These interactions induce the self-maintenance of CNI, promoting a vicious cycle. Certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a prominent role in these cell interactions and contribute to self-maintenance. Protease-activated receptors 2 and 4 (PAR-2 and PAR-4, respectively) and Mas-related G protein-coupled receptors (Mrgprs) are implicated in the synthesis and release of neuropeptides, proteases and soluble mediators from most cutaneous cells. Regulation of the expression and release of these mediators contributes to the vicious cycle of CNI. The authors propose certain hypothetical therapeutic options to interrupt this cycle, which might reduce skin symptoms and improve patient quality of life.

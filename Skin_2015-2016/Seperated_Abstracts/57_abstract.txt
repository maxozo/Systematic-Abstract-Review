TI Benzopyrene, a major polyaromatic hydrocarbon in smoke fume, mobilizes
   Langerhans cells and polarizes Th2/17 responses in epicutaneous protein
   sensitization through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
SO INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common disease with genetic and environmental interactions. We previously reported lifetime exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with adult-onset AD. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is important in regulating environmental exposure to xenobiotics, including benzopyrenes (BP), a major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) present in cigarette smoke. However, how AhR regulates immune responses in sensitization phase of AD remained elusive.
   Methods: We investigated how BP affects epicutaneous sensitization response through AhR axis. We compared AhR expression in skin from AD patients and healthy controls. We measured immune responses (Langerhans cell migration and T cell polarization in epicutaneous Ova sensitization in mice with or without AhR defect.
   Results: We found AhR and ARNT (AhR nuclear translocator) are upregulated in AD skin. BP exposure increases Langerhans cell migration, and increases IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17 levels when lymph node cells were re-challenged with Ova. The increased cytokine levels were attenuated in AhR defected mice. AhR agonists (BP and ITE) decreased E-cadherin expression, while AhR antagonist (CH223191) increased it in human primary keratinocytes.
   Conclusions: These results suggested AhR interacts with BP to polarize T cell responses, along with Langerhans cell migration. This study revealed a regulatory mechanism how cigarette smoking affects atopic sensitization through the benzopyrene-AhR interaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

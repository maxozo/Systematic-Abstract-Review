TI Protease and phospholipase activities of Candida spp. isolated from
   cutaneous candidiasis
SO REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE MICOLOGIA
AB Background: Cases of superficial and invasive mycoses caused by emerging species of Candida have been increasingly reported over the last thirty years. The production of hydrolytic enzymes plays a central role in the fungal infective process. In Candida infections the secretion of both proteases and phospholipases are well-known virulence attributes.
   Aims: To determine the protease and phospholipase production from 58 human clinical isolates of Candida obtained from individuals with cutaneous candidiasis seen in the Human and Veterinary Diagnostic Mycology Sector from Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Brazil, from November 2008 to August 2009.
   Methods: Fungal identification was performed using biochemical tests. Proteolytic activity was detected on agar plates containing bovine serum albumin, and phospholipase production was determined on egg-yolk plates.
   Results: The Candida species isolated were Candida parapsilosis (27.59%), Candida famata (18.96%), Candida albicans (15.52%), Candida haemulonii (12.06%), Candida ciferri (8.62%), Candida guilliermondii (6.90%), Candida tropicalis (5.17%) and Candida lipolytica (5.17%). All isolates of C. albicans produced both protease and phospholipase. As regards the isolates of non-C albicans Candida species, 53.06% and 4.08% were able to produce protease and phospholipase, respectively. For example, the majority of isolates of C parapsilosis (15/16) produced protease, while 40% of C ciferri isolates (2/5) were phospholipase producers. This study shows, for the first time, that C ciferri and C haemulonii strains were able to produce protease.
   Conclusions: Collectively, our results showed that different species of Candida isolated from cutaneous lesions were able to produce proteases and/or phospholipases, which are multifunctional molecules directly involved in the infectious process of these fungi.

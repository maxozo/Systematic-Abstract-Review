   HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression in keratinocytes
SO BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB In this study, we investigated the effect of TGF-1 on cholesterol synthesis in human keratinocytes. TGF-1 increased the level of cholesterol and the mRNA level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in human keratinocytes. These results show that TGF-1 induces cholesterol synthesis by increasing HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression in human keratinocytes.

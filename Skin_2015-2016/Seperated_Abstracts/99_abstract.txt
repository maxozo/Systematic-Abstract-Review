SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Here, we describe a novel human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) cross-linked using electron beam irradiation. Structural and biomechanical characteristics of the human ADM were assessed by infrared spectrometry and uni-axial tensile testing. Electron beam irradiation affects collagen secondary structure, which can be detected in the amide I spectral region (1660 cm(-1) and 1690 cm(-1)). At doses exceeding 25 kGy, cross-linking of the collagen matrix results in a denser, more stratified appearance and parallel arrangement, with significantly increased tensile strength and elastic modulus. In a micropig model, the implanted ADM elicits rapid host cell infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition; however, the delayed remodeling resulted in long-term structural integrity. Furthermore, mean densities of collagen and elastin, expression of extracellular matrix proteins, and microvessel formation within the implanted ADM increased significantly, whereas the thickness of the implanted ADM did not decrease during the course of the study. Compared with normal adjacent tissue, type I collagen mRNA levels in the ADM increased 12-fold at 3 months after implantation, and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA levels increased 3.3-fold at 2 months. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-9 mRNA levels were also elevated. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the structural and biomechanical properties of this novel cross-linked human ADM are adequate for use as a biologic tissue substitute.

TI Hen egg white ovomacroglobulin promotes fibroblast migration via
   mediating cell adhesion and cytoskeleton
SO JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Hen egg white ovomacroglobulin (OVM) possesses a variety of bioactivities and could potentially be used as a pharmaceutical agent. It has been reported that OVM is involved in wound healing and cancer pathological processes, and previous results suggest that OVM plays a potential role in cell proliferation and migration; however, this has not yet been proven. In the present study, the effects of OVMon fibroblast proliferation and migration were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Results of cell counting, cell viability, and cell cycle indicated that proliferation of fibroblasts was not altered by OVM treatment. However, scratch assays showed that OVM could promote the migration of 3 T6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human skin fibroblasts (HSF). Also, the adhesion of HSF to the collagen matrix was also enhanced by OVM treatment. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis showed that.. 1-integrin,.. -tubulin, and.. -actin were up-regulated while E-cadherin was down-regulated in OVM-treated HSF cells. The effect of OVM was silenced after forming a complex with trypsin, suggesting that the protease inhibitory ability of OVM is important for its effect on cell migration.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggested that promotion of OVM on cell migration was achieved by enhancing cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, reducing intercellular aggregation, and strengthening cytoskeleton. The finding of the promotion effect of OVMon cell migration is important for understanding its role in wound healing and cancer pathological processes. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

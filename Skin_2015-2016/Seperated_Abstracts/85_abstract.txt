TI Adiponectin regulates psoriasiform skin inflammation by suppressing
   IL-17 production from gamma delta-T cells
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Accumulating epidemiologic evidence has revealed that metabolic syndrome is an independent risk factor for psoriasis development and is associated with more severe psoriasis. Adiponectin, primarily recognized as a metabolic mediator of insulin sensitivity, has been newly drawing attention as a mediator of immune responses. Here we demonstrate that adiponectin regulates skin inflammation, especially IL-17-related psoriasiform dermatitis. Mice with adiponectin deficiency show severe psoriasiform skin inflammation with enhanced infiltration of IL-17-producing dermal V gamma 4+gamma delta-T cells. Adiponectin directly acts on murine dermal gamma delta-T cells to suppress IL-17 synthesis via AdipoR1. We furthermore demonstrate here that the adiponectin level of skin tissue as well as subcutaneous fat is decreased in psoriasis patients. IL-17 production from human CD4- or CD8-positive T cells is also suppressed by adiponectin. Our data provide a regulatory role of adiponectin in skin inflammation, which would imply a mechanism underlying the relationship between psoriasis and metabolic disorders.
